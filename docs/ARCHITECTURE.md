# nullset-decision-compiler: Architecture & System Topology

**Domain**: Minimum Evidence Discovery Engine to Overturn Decisions  
**Description**: Mathematical sensitivity solver identifying the minimum delta of new evidence required to reverse or invalidate a high-consequence decision.

## 2. Decision Processing Sequence

    autonumber
    participant Client as Decision Orchestrator
    participant Engine as nullset-decision-compiler Core
    participant Sim as Simulation Engine
    participant Ledger as Provenance Ledger

    Client->>Engine: Submit Decision Hypothesis & Constraints
    Engine->>Engine: Parse Hypothesis into Causal Graph Nodes
    Engine->>Sim: Launch Distributed Scenario Simulations
    Sim-->>Engine: Return 10,000 Branch Distributions & Variances
    Engine->>Engine: Compute Sensitivity Thresholds & Contradiction Risk
    Engine->>Ledger: Commit Cryptographic Audit Record
    Ledger-->>Engine: Block Verified (#48291)
    Engine-->>Client: Return Synthesized Decision Artifact & Confidence Bounds
```

## 3. Decision Lifecycle & State Transitions

```mermaid
stateDiagram-v2
    [*] --> Ingested: Submission
    Ingested --> Validated: Bounds Passed
    Validated --> Simulating: Launch Monte Carlo Matrix
    Simulating --> ContradictionCheck: Variance Evaluated
    ContradictionCheck --> Finalized: No Critical Flaws
    ContradictionCheck --> ReviewRequired: High Premise Sensitivity
    ReviewRequired --> Finalized: Operator Sign-off
    Finalized --> [*]
```

## 4. Architectural Guarantees
- **Deterministic Replayability**: Given identical seeds and evidence snapshots, simulation outcomes match identically.
- **Audit Immutability**: All evidence citations and score mutations are signed and logged to the internal provenance ledger.
